Slidely Task 2 - Create a windows desktop application similar to google form with backend - typescript and express

I have created the backend using visual studio code . I can create it without visual studio code . The logic remains the same except for a few keywords . installation also remains the same 

# backend 

branch backend contains all the backend files along with the read me file for instructions 

#frontend

branch frontend contains all front end files  the exe file is in \bin\release\net8.0-windows\publish 
The exe is called FormApp.exe

I will attach a video file and a documentation so that incase the files doesnt work you can see the working of the application :)
